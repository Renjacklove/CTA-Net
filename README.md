Overview
The model combines two main branches:

Local Branch: Uses convolutional layers to capture fine-grained, spatially localized features.
Global Branch: Utilizes transformer layers to capture global contextual information across the entire input image.
By fusing the outputs of both branches, the model is able to leverage both local and global information, making it effective for various computer vision tasks, especially image classification.

Architecture
The architecture consists of:

Patch Embedding: Divides input images into non-overlapping patches for the global branch, embedding each patch for processing.
Local Branch: Four stages of convolutional downsampling and feature extraction to capture local patterns.
Global Branch: Four stages of transformer-based layers, each with self-attention and feed-forward components to capture global dependencies.
Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AFFN): Combines local and global branch outputs at the final stage using an adaptive feature fusion network (AFFN).
Classification Head: A fully connected layer to produce the final classification output.

Usage
Training
To train the model on your dataset, prepare your data in the standard PyTorch Dataset format and use the MultiBranchModel as follows:

python
复制代码
import torch
from model import MultiBranchModel  # Assuming your model code is in model.py

# Define the model with appropriate parameters
model = MultiBranchModel(num_classes=10, patch_size=4, input_channels=3, embedding_dim=96)

# Define your training loop and optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Dummy training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for images, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
Inference
To use the model for inference:

python
复制代码
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    predictions = model(images)  # Replace `images` with your input batch
Configuring the Model
The model parameters can be adjusted for specific tasks. Key parameters include:

num_classes: Number of output classes.
patch_size: Size of patches for the transformer branch.
input_channels: Number of channels in input images (e.g., 3 for RGB).
embedding_dim: Dimension of the initial embedding in the global branch.
stage_depths, attention_heads, and conv_stage_depths: Customize the depth of each stage and the number of attention heads in the transformer layers.
Refer to the MultiBranchModel class in model.py for a detailed list of configurable parameters.

Example
Here's a quick example of loading the model and running a forward pass with random data:

python
复制代码
import torch
from model import MultiBranchModel

# Initialize model
model = MultiBranchModel(num_classes=10)

# Generate random input data
dummy_data = torch.randn(4, 3, 224, 224)  # Batch of 4 images, 3 channels, 224x224 resolution

# Run forward pass
output = model(dummy_data)
print("Output shape:", output.shape)  # Expected shape: [4, num_classes]
Results
After training on your dataset, you can evaluate the model's performance. Add metrics and performance here as you test the model on various datasets.
